## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> "I want to build an application that i can click a button to talk to it and it will take my recording and transcribe it into a text and then I want to be able to store, save, edit, organize these notes. Essentially a personal notion site that allows me to do voice to text for making my notes. I also want an AI chat bot on the pages that allows me to ask AI questions about my notes"

### Code Generation Prompt

> "Based on the content model I created for "I want to build an application that i can click a button to talk to it and it will take my recording and transcribe it into a text and then I want to be able to store, save, edit, organize these notes. Essentially a personal notion site that allows me to do voice to text for making my notes. I also want an AI chat bot on the pages that allows me to ask AI questions about my notes", now build a complete web application that showcases this content. Include a modern, responsive design with proper navigation, content display, and user-friendly interface. And I want to add an access code to the environments to allow me to be the only one to use this application."

The app has been tailored to work with your existing Cosmic content structure and includes all the features requested above.

## üì° Cosmic SDK Examples

### Fetching Notes with Collections and Tags
```typescript
const notes = await cosmic.objects
  .find({ type: 'notes' })
  .props(['id', 'title', 'slug', 'metadata'])
  .depth(1)
```

### Creating a New Voice Note
```typescript
const newNote = await cosmic.objects.insertOne({
  type: 'notes',
  title: noteTitle,
  metadata: {
    title: noteTitle,
    content: transcribedText,
    transcription_status: 'completed',
    word_count: wordCount,
    recording_duration: duration,
    priority: 'Medium'
  }
})
```

### Managing Chat Sessions
```typescript
const chatSession = await cosmic.objects.insertOne({
  type: 'chat-sessions',
  title: sessionTitle,
  metadata: {
    session_title: sessionTitle,
    conversation_data: { messages },
    session_summary: summary,
    last_activity: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]
  }
})
```

## üåü Cosmic CMS Integration

This application is built on a robust content model with four main object types:

- **Notes**: Core voice notes with transcription, metadata, and organization
- **Collections**: Grouped note organization with color coding
- **Tags**: Flexible categorization system with visual identification
- **Chat Sessions**: AI conversation history and context

The app leverages Cosmic's depth parameter to efficiently fetch related objects and uses the object metafields for seamless note organization.
